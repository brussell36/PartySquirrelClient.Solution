## Description

_This application will let users create accounts and add squirrels they would like to party with to their individual parties. Each user will have a party and can view other users parties. They will also have the ability to add squirrels from others parties to their own. Users will also be able to post messages to each other on their the party pages. The application uses the Pexels API to generate random pictures of squirrels that a user can either "Go Nuts!" or say "No Nuts!". The go nuts button will allow the user to create a profile of that squirrel and add them to their party. The no nuts button will reload the page and show a fresh image for the user._<br><br>
